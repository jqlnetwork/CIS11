--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.5:

1. The CPU contains a clock speed, arithmetic logic unit, and a control unit.
Clock speed to keep tempo among other operations; ALU for calculations, and control unit is for steps.

2. The buses are D C A. Data bus, control bus and access bus.

3. It takes more memory access because memory is not internal but registers are.

4.  a.) fetching the instructions from the instruction queue.
	b.) The cpu decodes by looking at binary bit pattern.
	c.) fetches the operands if the 2nd step finds any in the binary bit pattern.
	d.) The cpu executes the instruction and if any operand is found earlier, it'll store the result inside.

5. I explain this in detail on the previous question on letters c and d.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.3:

5. The purpose of the 8259A PIC controller is that whenever we want our peripherals to respond instead of waiting,
this PIC controller allows us pause the CPU and read our instructions immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.2:

1. Level 3 because high level languages is used the most by people,
and that makes the application program the most portable as well.

3. Data is not updated with time and companies want to release more new 
software/hardware that may or may not be compatible with older versions.

4. So between the OS function(Level 2) and Hardware(Level 0), the answer is BIOS Function(Level 1).

5. No, I have built a couple of computers now, both with windows and linux mint and it would be
inefficient to have separate BIOS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8 Review:

7. The control unit preforms FPA from the floating point unit.

8. 48 bits in the data register.

9. True, because of the 64 bits used in both instruction sets.

10. False, because doesn't the Floating-Point prove that it can just use 48 bits?

12. False, SRAM is faster cache memory than dynamic memory.

19. False, a bus are parallel wires that sit on the motherboard.

20. False, CMOS ram can lose its memory when disconnected, 
such as me taking mine out when i want to reset my motherboard.

25. ''Assembly Program'' can start to manipulate input and output when the levels are 0, 1, 2.
It can change hardware, the BIOS and the OS. Once it reaches level 3, it is no longer assembly.

26. So that you can take advantage of the special features that the hardware provides. It can also reduce
the amount of memory taken up by the OS.
